This directory holds scripts and associated data to support maintenance of
ZAM optimization:

find-special-script-funcs.sh
	A shell script that prints to stdout a sorted list of script-level
	functions that the event engine knows about. Invoke with the path
	to the top-level src/ directory.

	Use this to compare with Special-Script-Funcs.list to see
	whether there are any new such functions (or old ones that have
	been removed).  If so, update src/script_opt/FuncInfo.cc and then
	Special-Script-Funcs.list accordingly.

Special-Script-Funcs.list
	The known-to-the-event-engine scripts that were present last time
	ZAM maintenance included looking for any updates to these.

In addition, the opt/ZAM-bif-tracking.zeek BTest, when run with the -a zam
alternative, flags updates that should be made to src/script_opt/FuncInfo.cc.
