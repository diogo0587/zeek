This directory holds scripts and associated data to support maintenance of
ZAM optimization:

list-bifs.zeek
	A Zeek script that prints to stdout a sorted list of the BiFs
	available for the Zeek invocation.

	Use this to compare with BiFs.list to see whether there are any
	new BiFs (or old ones that have been removed). If so, update
	src/script_opt/FuncInfo.cc and then BiFs.list accordingly.

BiFs.list
	The BiFs that were present last time ZAM maintenance included
	looking for any updates to available BiFs.
