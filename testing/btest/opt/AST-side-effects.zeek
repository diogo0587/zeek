# @TEST-EXEC: TEST_DIFF_CANONIFIER=$SCRIPTS/diff-remove-abspath btest-diff output

# This is a subtle & extensive test of the AST optimizer used by ZAM, in
# particular its CSE = Common Subexpression Elimination functionality, whereby
# it reuses previously computed values rather than recomputing them. This test
# in particular focuses on that functionality in the context of side-effects
# that arise due to either implicit or explicit function calls. The implicit
# ones (such as table &default functions) are the trickiest, because they
# can in principle access or modify state that leads to *other* implicit
# function calls.
#
# Unlike nearly all Zeek BTests, the heart of the output is intermediary
# information produced by "-O dump-xform", not the final output. The dump
# implicitly reveals where the AST optimizer reuses expressions previously
# computed (into temporaries) and where it refrains from doing so because
# in principle the re-use is unsafe due to possible modifications to the
# original expression. Many of the tests print the same set of values twice in
# a row, often to see whether the first "print" requires correctly re-computing
# an expression or inheriting its value from a previous computation. The
# second "print" generally ensures that given the lack of potential
# side-effects, the values from the first "print" are re-used, although for
# some tests they need to instead be re-computed.
#
# If the dumped intermediary information agrees but there's a difference in
# the final output as the Zeek script executes, that reflects a bug subsequent
# to the AST optimizer (typically, this will be in ZAM's low-level optimizer).
#
# Changes to the AST processing used by script optimization can introduce
# benign differences to the intermediary information, such as introducing
# or removing some temporary variables. These require hand inspection to
# determine whether they reflect a problem.
#
# We divide the tests up into a number of different event handlers. This
# keeps the AST for each group of tests from getting too complex (especially
# if later tests wind up reusing values from much earlier tests, which can
# be hard to manually verify for correctness). We enable ZAM optimization
# for *only* those handlers to avoid complications in the output unrelated
# to these tests. We use distinct event handlers, rather than multiple
# handlers for the same event, to avoid coalescence of the handlers. Doing
# this explicitly rather than using "-O no-inline" is preferrable because
# it means the testing still includes any issues that the inliner might
# introduce.
#
# Any time you make a change to the final output the script produces, confirm
# that running Zeek *without* script optimization produces that same output.
